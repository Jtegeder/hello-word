    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction </h2>
    <p style="color: white;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">My name is Jack Tegeder, and I am 22 years old. I was born in Wisconsin, and plan on moving back there after graduating from Lewis University. My father’s name is Thomas, and my mother’s name is Nancy. I have one sibling named Marissa; she is a freshman at the University of Wisconsin. My major is aviation administration, and my minor is aviation flight. After I graduate I plan on working a job in sales. </p>

        <li style="color:white">How to write my own Code</li>
        <li style="color:white">Pros and Cons of different software/applications</li>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p style="color:white"> My favorite hobbies include working out, being outside, and spending time with friends/family. I swam here at Lewis for four years, but due to covid I chose not to take my fifth year of eligibility. This summer I got really big into road biking, and nearly rode every day. Since moving here to Illinois there are a lot less places to bike, so I mostly run and lift weights to get exercise. Besides that, and when the weathers not so nice, I enjoy to play video games with friends or just by myself. I like to play sports video games primary, such as NBA 2k, or MLB the Show…sometimes I spend too much time playing video games.</p> 
    
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Greatest Innovations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:white">World Wide Web (browser and html)</li>
        <li style="color:white">Mobile Phones</li>
        <li style="color:white">Social Media/Email</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Fun Fact</h2>
    <p style="color:white">I would say one fun fact about me is that I’m a pilot, at Lewis University however this is nothing too special. Although, when I was younger, I went dog sledding in Canada. At the time I didn’t think much of it, but looking back It has to be one of the coolest things I’ve ever done. My scrum team can remember me as the “kid who went dog sledding”. </p>
